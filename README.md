[(see it live!)](http://stonecypher.github.io/flocks-mini-todo/)

[Flocks](https://github.com/StoneCypher/flocks.js) is a state management library for React, intended to serve a similar purpose to [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html), Facebook's application architecture layer for React.

Flocks does roughly the same thing, conceptually, as Flux, but does so in a far simpler fashion.

This application is a trivial todo list, because Flux and all the Flux replacements offer todo lists, so this seems like a natural comparison point.  More examples will be provided soon.
